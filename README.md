# Training with JavaScript & jQuery

Here focus is given to JavaScript.  
jQuery will also be used.  
Here I will often code tutorials designed by educational establishments (such as [3W Academy](https://3wa.fr/), [Grafikart](https://www.grafikart.fr/), [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/)), but the code I publish here is always my own, before checking the way of coding of this establishment.
